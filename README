                      Apache HTTPD module mod_define

  What is it?
  -----------

  The Apache HTTPD module mod_define allows to define variables
  in the web server configuration files and to use them later
  in the files. This allows to build configurations which are
  easier to understand and maintain.

  HTTPD version 2.0 and 2.2 by default allow the use of environment
  variables in the configuration. Beware that those are not changed
  when the web server gets restarted.

  All variables defined by mod_define are reread during restarts,
  because their definition is part of the configuration.

  The Latest Version
  ------------------

  Details of the latest version can be found on the module
  project page under <http://people.apache.org/~rjung/mod_define/>.

  Documentation
  -------------

  The documentation available as of the date of this release is
  included in HTML format in the module source download.

  Building
  --------

  The module gets build using the apxs script, which comes as part
  of Apache HTTPD. Download the source tarball of the module,
  uncompress and extract it and then call

    apxs -o mod_define.so -c mod_define.c

  inside the resulting directory.

  Installation
  ------------

  Move the file mod_define.so resulting from the build step above
  into the modules directory of Apache HTTPD or any other directory you
  like. Add the following line to your HTTPD configuration:

    LoadModule define_module modules/mod_define.so

  If you choose another directory for the module, you need to adjust
  the last token accordingly.

  For the directives provided by the module see the provided HTML documentation.
